Well. Finally got around to putting this old website together. Neat thing about it - powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and I can use Markdown to author my posts. It actually is a lot easier than I thought it was going to be.
<svg id="scene" height="200" width="300">
  <line id="string" x1="150" y1="50" x2="250" y2="50" stroke="black" stroke-width="4" />
  <!--circle id="ball" cx="250" cy="50" r="5" fill="black" /-->
</svg>

<p id = "paragraph"> </p>
<button type="button" onclick="startAnimation()">Start</button>
<button type="button" onclick="stopAnimation()">Stop</button>

<script src="{{ base.url | prepend: site.url }}/assets/js/first_script.js"></script>
